# Metalhead-Quiz

# Description
My motivation for this project was to create a functioning quiz going over facts about the Metal Music genre using HTML, CSS and javascript and utilizing web API within the javascript. Throughout the project i was able to learn more how certain functions work, such as addEventListener for buttons and querySelector to pull elements from the HTML. The most challenging parts for me was originally getting the timer running property without lag and when the buttons are pressed starting the quiz. I also had difficulty with understanding the localStorage.
